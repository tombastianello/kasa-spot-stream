## TP-Link Kasa Spot Stream
This docker image is intended to allow streaming of Kasa Spot KC100 (should work with other models) to any streaming capable application such as VLC and home assistant.

## Deployment
Running this application only requires 3 environment variables:
- `KASA_USERNAME`: Your TP-Link Kasa username.
- `KASA_PASSWORD`: Your TP-Link Kasa password.
- `SPOT_IP`: The local network IP address of your Spot Camera.

More detailed documentation to come soon. Please note that this is still a work in progress and will likely break.
